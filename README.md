Hi there, I am Saif ðŸ‘‹  I'm looking to make a career transition into CS. After very influential programming classes in high-school, I have always stayed close to software. Now get to be in a full stack engineering program at The University of Helsinki 

I'm a coder and [data hoarder](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder)/enthusiast, with expertise in Javascript (Node.js, Redwood.js, Preact.js), C#, Rust, and with extensive experience coding in Typescript, Lua, Ruby, and Python. My area of interest lies within databases, with a focus on edge computing, and software architecture, having had experience with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLITE, Redis, SurrealDB, Firebase, and TiDB.

I am open sourcing [geacron Interactive World History Atlas since 3000 BC](http://geacron.com) to make it a blazingly fast and easy to use API
