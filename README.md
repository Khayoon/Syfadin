Hi there, I am Saif ðŸ‘‹  I'm looking to make a career transition into CS. After my very first programming classes in high-school, I fell in love with it. I had a brief stint in fine arts but have always stayed close to software development. Now I get to be in the full stack engineering program at The University of Helsinki 

I'm a coder and [data hoarder](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder), with expertise in React Native, and with extensive experience coding in Typescript, and Python. I am using the MERN stack when needed and MOFD when I can. My area of interest lies within databases, with a focus on distributed databases, highly-available architecture and database paradigms, having had experience with Firebase, MySQL, and MongoDB

I am recreating [The Interactive World History Atlas since 3000 BC](http://geacron.com)
